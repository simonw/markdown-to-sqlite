CLI tool for loading markdown files into a SQLite database.

YAML embedded in the markdown files will be used to populate additional columns.
See the [pandoc documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-variables)
for more information. Only caveat is that the embedded YAML has to be
terminated with `---` instead.

    Usage: markdown-to-sqlite [OPTIONS] DBNAME TABLE PATHS...

For example:

    $ markdown-to-sqlite docs.db documents file1.md file2.md

## Breaking change

Prior to version 1.0 this argument order was different - markdown files were listed before the database and table.
